# Eternia Quest System (EQS)

EQS is a data-driven quest system plugin for Unreal Engine which I use in my pet project. It provides a simple interface without complicated
pre-configuration and rich blueprint support.

**At the moment, the plugin is extremely unstable and is under active development. Use at your own risk!**

## Features

| Time-based quests    | Yes          |
| Multiplayer          | No           |
| Quest branching      | No           |

## Supported UE versions

## Installation

The recommended way to add the plugin to your project is to clone it as a git submodule.

### Git submodule

```
git submodule add https://github.com/j0ez1/EterniaQuestSystem.git ${PROJECT_DIR}/Plugins/EterniaQuestSystem
```

### From Marketplace

TBD

---
The plugin is enabled automatically after it is added to the project. Just restart the engine.
